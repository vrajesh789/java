1. How do you find the nth highest salary in a table?
Answer: Using the LIMIT clause with ORDER BY:
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT n-1, 1;


Alternatively, using a subquery:
SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);



2. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?
Answer:
- WHERE: Filters rows before aggregation.
- HAVING: Filters groups after aggregation. Example:

SELECT department, AVG(salary) 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Sales' 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;



3. How do you optimize a slow-running query?
Answer:
- Use indexes on frequently queried columns.
- Avoid SELECT *; specify required columns.
- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans.
- Optimize joins by ensuring indexed columns are used in ON conditions.
- Avoid unnecessary subqueries; use JOIN instead.


4. What are the different types of joins in SQL?
Answer:
- INNER JOIN: Returns matching rows from both tables.
- LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
- FULL JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables, with NULL for unmatched rows.
- CROSS JOIN: Produces a Cartesian product of both tables.


5. How do you handle duplicate records in a table?
Answer: To find duplicates:
SELECT column1, COUNT(*) 
FROM table_name 
GROUP BY column1 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;


To delete duplicates:
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id) 
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY column1
);



6. What is a window function, and how is it used?
Answer: A window function performs calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Example:
SELECT employee_id, salary, 
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank 
FROM employees;


This ranks employees by salary within each department.

7. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
Answer:
- UNION: Combines results from two queries and removes duplicates.
- UNION ALL: Combines results from two queries without removing duplicates.


8. How do you implement indexing, and what are its types?
Answer: Indexes improve query performance by reducing data retrieval time. Types:
- Clustered Index: Sorts and stores data rows in the table based on key values.
- Non-Clustered Index: Creates a separate structure for the index.
- Unique Index: Ensures all values in the indexed column are unique.
- Full-Text Index: Used for text search.


9. How do you ensure data integrity in a database?
Answer:
- Use primary keys to uniquely identify rows.
- Use foreign keys to enforce referential integrity.
- Define constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK.
- Implement triggers for custom validation.


10. What are ACID properties in a database?
Answer:
- Atomicity: Ensures all operations in a transaction are completed or none are.
- Consistency: Ensures the database remains in a valid state after a transaction.
- Isolation: Ensures transactions do not interfere with each other.
- Durability: Ensures committed transactions are saved permanently.
